Next steps: 
* maybe move all filtering to reactive chunk of its own
* apply filters to all tabs
* add more assets to csv file
* mebbe add images and some styling?
* Rename all asset properties to be human friendly... in fact, probably at the master level create a macro to push csv file out with the aliases already performed...
